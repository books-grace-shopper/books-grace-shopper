# Bookazon

Bookazon is a simulated e-commerce website. We sell fake books. 

## getting started

Signup or login with google, or create an account. Creating an account is optional; you may shop anonymously, if you wish.

Browse 1000+ books by title or author, add/remove them from your cart. When you're ready, you can checkout. Authenticated users may also rate and review books.

## tech stack

Bookazon was built with React.js, Redux, Express, and Sequelize.js with a PostgreSQL database.
